This plugin allows key aspects of BuddyPress administration to be devolved to non admin users.

== Description ==

BP Devolved Authority allows site administrators to devolve the ability to manage Groups, Activity, Members and Emails to other site members.

BuddyPress has not traditionally allowed site administrators to grant authority to manage aspect of BuddyPress to users without 'manage_options' capability. This plugin changes that and allows each of the BP Components to be managed by site members so long as they have the 'edit_posts' capability.

Note that roles allowed to manage members should also have the 'list_users' capability, this allows the users list menu item to be displayed in the dashboard for that member.

Once the plugin is activated, visit the Settings>>BP Devolved Authority page to choose which roles can manage your BP Components. 

This plugin needs BuddyPress to work.

== Installation ==
